# Hey, I'm Rahul. 👋

This is the source code for my personal corner of the internet, **[rahulsetrakian.in](https://rahulsetrakian.in)**.

It's where I dump my brain—notes on cybersecurity, CTF writeups, and whatever tech I'm currently obsessing over. No fancy corporate fluff, just a raw log of what I'm learning.

## Under the Hood
It's a static site built with **Astro** (because it's blazing fast) and **Tailwind**. I manage the content using **Sveltia CMS** so I can write directly in the browser without cloning the repo every time.

Credit where credit is due: This looks good because it's a fork of the **[Erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite)** theme. I just tweaked it to fit my chaos.

## Running it
If you really want to run this locally for some reason:

1.  Clone it.
2.  `npm install`
3.  `npm run dev:all` (starts both site and CMS proxy)

That's it.
