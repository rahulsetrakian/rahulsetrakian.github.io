Today, I want to talk about an initiative led by [Andrew Crotty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-crotty-377b3466/) ([GingerHacker](https://youtube.com/channel/UCGX_oAbc0_CLEdwMI5n64oQ)). After joining the community, I saw for myself how they support people who are new to cybersecurity.

First, here’s a tough truth about cybersecurity: it’s really hard to get started, and the costs are extremely high. It might not seem fair, but that’s how things are in the industry. I’ll share some price examples below to give you an idea.

1. **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) – $425 USD**
2. **EC-Council CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) – $950 USD**
3. **Offensive Security OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) – $1,749 USD**

From these prices, you can clearly see how expensive certifications are. They are often treated as industry standards and are mentioned in many job postings. Even so-called entry-level jobs frequently list them as requirements. Without them on your resume, you can easily be filtered out.

But not all hope is lost. There is an initiative that may help you land a job or sponsor your certification — and not just that, it can also help you prepare to pass the exam. It’s called the Ginger Hacker Initiative.

In their own words:

> “The Ginger Hacker Initiative is breaking down barriers to entry in the cybersecurity field by providing accessible education and resources.”

Not only do they help you get started, but they also provide mentorship. It’s all made possible through donations and direct support from the community.

I also want to share my personal story after joining the community. I had the opportunity to talk with people from different fields and backgrounds — many of them, like me, still learning and trying to break into cybersecurity. I instantly felt the positive and welcoming vibe of the server, which was one of the reasons I decided to regularly interact and become more involved.

Since I was training on TryHackMe and had already spent my savings on the annual premium subscription, I didn’t have enough left to purchase [SEC1](https://tryhackme.com/certification/cyber-security-101). I was planning to buy it once I had saved enough. I joined the voice chat to get reviews and opinions about the certification. As it happened, Andrew himself was there. During our conversation, he realised I was genuinely interested in taking SEC1 but couldn’t afford it at the time.

He offered to sponsor the certification.

In the end, he not only sponsored SEC1 but also provided SEC0 as well. That was genuinely kind. What he offered didn’t feel like charity — it felt like an opportunity. And that’s what I believe the initiative stands for: helping people like me, and many others, move forward.

I’m writing this to show my appreciation and also to promote the initiative. I have always been an advocate for free education and access to learning. I believe that every person who is willing to learn should have the opportunity to do so without being blocked by a paywall. In the modern era, education should be a human right.

If you connected with what I wrote and want to contribute — or if you’re someone like me who can help spread the word and take advantage of the opportunities they offer — I’ve shared all the links below. Please check them out and show your support.
